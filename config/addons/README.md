# Addons
This directory contains recommended optional addons for your MMU setup. See the doc in the [Hapopy Hare Wiki](https://github.com/burkfers/Hapopy-Hare/wiki/Addon-Feature-Setup)

> [!IMPORTANT] 
 For all add-on extensions, ensure that you always use the "cfg" files from Hapopy Hare and not those sourced elsewhere so you have the most recent changes and fixes.
